Using (mostly) undocumented windows functions for kernel <=> usermode communication.
While ALPC can also be used for UM <=> UM, this example only demonstrates KM <=> UM.
I have provided R/W functionality as a POC. Feel free to add onto the project as you please.

While other examples of ALPC exist, most are very outdated, and most importantly I felt like doing it.
